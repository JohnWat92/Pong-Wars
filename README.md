**How to Play**


The objective of this game is to rebound the balls so they pass the opponents paddle.
You are allowed to move sideways closer to the mid-line and even past it, to give your opponents a harder time, but be careful! 
After you score, the ball spawns in the center again, so get back to position quickly
